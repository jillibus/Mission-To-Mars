## Overview
This project is to create an application that can keep up-to-date on the latest Mars News, published on the NASA news website, utilizing Web Scraping cabilities and presenting them into a web page, that can be refreshed upon a simple button click. 

I will be using several different websites for '_web scraping_' and software tools to accomplish this task.

### Process
**WebScraping**
- I had to understand the overall process of _Web Scraping_ and how my application's flow would work.

**HTML5**
- I had to understand how to use HTML Tags, and set up my _index.html_ file utilizing the basic html setup for web-pages.

**Web Page Layout**
- I had to design how my application (Web Page) would look like and where the results I retrieved would show up at.

**HTML Tags and Web Page Layout**
- With the HTML5 tags known, and my Web Layout designed, it was now time to determine where these 2 areas met.
